# Basic Coding Quiz

## Description
The purpose of this project was to get familiar with JavaScript functions along with implementing knowledge of HTML and CSS. This project allows the user to take a quiz that tests their understanding of basic code. I was challenged by how much JavaScript was needed for this basic coding quiz to be functional.
